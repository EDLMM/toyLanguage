# Toy Language

A toy language for homework project, based on Clojure language.

Here instapasre and ASM pacakge are used.

The parser will build an AST for the program content.

The interpreters for if,while and for flow control are finished.

The compiler of if-case is finished.

## Fixme

In the compiler part, the while-case does not work because of the ASM feature missing. However, the if-case works normally.
